# UTD Grades DB

This project contains the schema for the backing SQLite database and all related types/scripts. Probably most notable
is the [import script](./src/import/index.ts).

Note: You probably don't need to develop directly in this subproject unless you know what you're doing (i.e., you don't
need to run `npm install` or `npm run createDb` in this directory). See the [project-level readme](../README.md) for
instructions.
