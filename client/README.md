# UTD Grades Client

A React.js client built using Next.js and styled-components.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Change into the `client` folder
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Access the client at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will hot reload as you make changes.

## Deployment

The client is deployed to production automatically on commits to master. To trigger a manual production deploy, do the following:
