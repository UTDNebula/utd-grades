# UTD Grades Client

A React.js app built using Next.js and styled-components.

Note: You probably don't need to develop directly in this subproject unless you know what you're doing (i.e., you don't
need to run `npm install` or `npm run dev` in this directory). See the [project-level readme](../README.md) for
instructions.

If you really want to anyway, make sure that the database is created first (see [db](../db/README.md)).
